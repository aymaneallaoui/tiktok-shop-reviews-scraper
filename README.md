# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aymaneallaoui/tiktok-shop-reviews-scraper.git
cd tiktok-shop-reviews-scraper

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the scraper
python aymane_aallaoui_tiktok_shop_code.py
```

### Advanced Setup with Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

python setup.py
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from aymane_aallaoui_tiktok_shop_code import TikTokShopScraper

# Initialize scraper
scraper = TikTokShopScraper(headless=True)

# Run complete scraping process
reviews = scraper.run_complete_scraping()

# Save to CSV
scraper.save_to_csv(reviews, "reviews_output.csv")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from config import get_config
from aymane_aallaoui_tiktok_shop_code import TikTokShopScraper

# Load configuration
config = get_config()

# Initialize with custom settings
scraper = TikTokShopScraper(
    headless=config.HEADLESS_BROWSER,
    proxy="http://proxy-server:port"  # Optional
)

# Scrape specific market
products = scraper.search_lancome_products('vietnam')
for product in products:
    reviews = scraper.scrape_product_reviews(product)
    print(f"Found {len(reviews)} reviews for {product.name}")
```

## 📊 Output Format

The scraper generates a CSV file with the following structure:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `product_url` | Direct URL to the product page |
| `product_name` | Name of the Lancôme product |
| `reviewer_name` | Name/username of the reviewer |
| `rating` | Numerical rating (1-5 stars) |
| `review_text` | Full text of the review |
| `review_date` | Date when review was posted |
| `verified_purchase` | Whether purchase was verified |
| `helpful_votes` | Number of helpful votes |
| `review_id` | Unique identifier for the review |
| `country_market` | Market code (vn/sa) |
| `scrape_timestamp` | When the data was collected |

### Sample Output

```csv
product_url,product_name,reviewer_name,rating,review_text,review_date,verified_purchase,helpful_votes,review_id,country_market,scrape_timestamp
https://shop.tiktok.com/vn/product/123,Lancôme Advanced Génifique,UserXYZ,5,Amazing serum! Really improved my skin texture...,2024-08-15,Yes,12,abc123def456,vn,2024-08-21T21:30:00
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional proxy configuration
export PROXY_URL="http://username:password@proxy-server:port"

# Environment mode
export ENVIRONMENT="production"  # or "development"
```

### Config Customization

Edit `config.py` to modify:
- Target markets and languages
- Scraping delays and timeouts
- CSS selectors (if site structure changes)
- Output file names
- Browser options

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run basic tests
python test_scraper.py

# Test specific functionality
python -c "from test_scraper import test_product_search; test_product_search()"
```

## 📋 Methodology Overview

The scraping approach follows a two-phase strategy:

### Phase 1: Product Discovery
1. **Search-based**: Query TikTok Shop search with "lancome"
2. **Brand page**: Navigate to official Lancôme store pages
3. **URL extraction**: Collect product URLs using multiple CSS selectors
4. **Validation**: Filter results to ensure Lancôme brand match

### Phase 2: Review Collection
1. **Page navigation**: Visit each product URL
2. **Dynamic loading**: Handle infinite scroll and "Load More" buttons
3. **Review extraction**: Parse review elements with fallback selectors
4. **Data normalization**: Clean and standardize collected data
5. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate reviews

## 🛡️ Anti-Detection Measures

- **User Agent Rotation**: Random browser signatures
- **Request Delays**: Human-like browsing patterns
- **Session Management**: Proper cookie and session handling
- **Proxy Support**: IP rotation capabilities
- **Stealth Mode**: Disabled automation detection

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Market Availability**: TikTok Shop may not be available in all target markets
- **Product Availability**: Lancôme products may be limited or unavailable
- **Site Changes**: Website structure changes may require selector updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive scraping may trigger anti-bot measures

### Ethical Considerations
- Respects `robots.txt` when present
- Implements reasonable delays between requests
- Uses public data only
- No authentication bypass attempts

### Legal Compliance
- Scraping for research/assessment purposes
- No commercial use without proper authorization
- Respects website terms of service

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No products found"**
```bash
# Solution: Check if TikTok Shop is available in target market
# Try with headless=False to see what's happening
python -c "TikTokShopScraper(headless=False).search_lancome_products('vietnam')"
```

**"ChromeDriver issues"**
```bash
# Solution: Update ChromeDriver
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
```

**"Access denied/blocked"**
```bash
# Solution: Use proxy or increase delays
# Edit config.py to increase MIN_DELAY and MAX_DELAY
```

### Debug Mode

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Run with visible browser
scraper = TikTokShopScraper(headless=False)
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For Large Scale Scraping
1. Use headless mode: `headless=True`
2. Disable images: Add `--disable-images` to Chrome options
3. Use proxy rotation for IP diversity
4. Implement distributed scraping across multiple machines
5. Use checkpointing to resume interrupted sessions

### Memory Management
```python
# Process products in batches
for batch in batches(products, batch_size=5):
    reviews = process_batch(batch)
    save_checkpoint(reviews)
```
